# Gravel

Gravel is my Summer 2022 personal project. This project focuses on creating an Arch Linux ARM compute cluster using low-cost Rock64 Single-Board Computers (SBC) and utilizing it to analyze data gathered from the European Space Agency's Space Debris Database.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and demonstrate my knowledge of engineering principles and technologies through the design, building, and testing process. This project also demonstrates my knowledge of networking technologies, Unix and Linux tools, data science technologies and principles, and professional engineering principles. More generally, this project also demonstrates the accessibility of higher-end computing technologies to the average engineering student.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main parts, the comppute cluster itself and the data analysis for which it is used. The compute cluster is made up of 3 Rock64 2GB SBCs running Arch Linux ARM, managed by the SLRUM workload manager in conjunction with OpenMPI.
